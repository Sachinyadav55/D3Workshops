# Anscombe Quartet Scatter Plot - Part One

Now that we have had a chance to explore Anscombe's Quartet a bit, let's plot it out with D3! :D

Our creation will end up looking something like this:

<img src="imgs/anscombe1.png" width="500px;"/>

You can find a completed version of this on [my bl.ocks page](https://bl.ocks.org/molliemarie/f30308e1c28a3fbda8eda6c72cfa9fc7).

**Note:** Since Mike doesn't [technically](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887118) make valid HTML pages, we're not going to either â€” here's how we'll start our own empty HTML pages from here on out:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <style type="text/css">
    /*css to go here*/
  </style>

  <body></body>

 <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
 
  <script>
    //JS to go here
  </script>

  ```

  
First, go to [this pen](https://codepen.io/molliemarie/pen/vQwrBm) and fork it. You'll notice the code is set up like above, plus I've added styling that will add a pink border around any svg we might draw.

Let's get started!!
